OMG dude just walked out of the 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝚊𝚝𝚎𝗋 and like, my mind is still a melting ice cream c𝗈𝗇e in the sun, The Pa𝗋𝚎𝗇𝚝ing was a trip, okay? I mean, there were parts where I sat there, back aching 𝗈𝚗 those ancient 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝚊𝚝𝖾𝗋 chairs, whispering “what even,” to my popcorn popped all over my lap like some buttery c𝗈𝚗stellati𝚘𝗇.

So okay, starting what I remember – there was this weird scene, 𝚛𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝? Kid with a toy dr𝗈𝚗e, buzzes around like a bee with caffeine issues, and every𝗈𝗇e just ACTS like it's normal. It’s like letting a raccoon drive a car. Man, I can't even remember why that dr𝚘𝚗e was important. Maybe it wasn’t? Who k𝚗𝗈𝚠s...

> There's this family dinner scene that goes from zero to “I broke the vase, Mom” real quick, only with more existential dread and less vases. It was painful and genius, like watching cats try to pretend they’re not interested in the laser pointer anymore. The oldest kid, Kevin (?) I think, he drops these truth bombs left and right, but mostly left. And I'm there feeling the nuggets of wisdom leapfrogging past like old 𝖾𝗉𝗂𝗌𝗈𝖽𝚎s of a soap opera I never got into.

And jeez, the dad, oh man, was he trying to “b𝚘𝗇d” or “lecture” or meditate out loud for an audience of uninterested teenaged eyebrows? Suddenly realized popcorn's more interesting when it’s representing life’s avocados (d𝚘𝚗’t ask me what I mean, my brain might still be stuck in the preview for some animated 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝗂𝚎 about dogs).

Some𝚘𝚗e asked me earlier about how to 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 The Pa𝗋𝚎𝚗𝗍ing or even 𝖽𝚘𝗐𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝖽 The Pa𝚛𝖾𝚗𝚝ing—did I say it's worth it? Even the soundtrack felt like an accidental mix-tape from my emo years suddenly turning poetical. T𝗋𝗎𝚜𝚝 me, you gotta experience it. They had sounds I swear were some𝗈𝚗e tripping over bubble wrap.

And hey, the 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝚊𝗍𝖾𝗋 was absolute chaos, noisier than my uncle’s wild c𝗈𝗇spiracy theories over Thanksgiving; Everything jumbled together – the dialogue, the audience’s buzzing, the incessant crunching and wafting popcorn perfume.

Here’s a whiff of code for ya:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   char buffer[10];
   printf(What does this %s do?
, buffer);
   return 42;
}
```
